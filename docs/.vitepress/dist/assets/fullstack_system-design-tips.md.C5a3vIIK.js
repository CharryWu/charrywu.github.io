Note, that in some cases, the answer is different depending on the part of the system -- as you&#39;ll see is the case here.</li><li>Read vs write ratio: is this a read heavy system or write heavy? Are either notably heavy for any reason?</li><li>Query access pattern: Is the access pattern of the system regular or are their patterns or bursts that require particular attention. For example, the holidays for shopping sites or popular events for ticket booking.</li></ul><h2 id="api-endpoints" tabindex="-1">API Endpoints <a class="header-anchor" href="#api-endpoints" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;API Endpoints&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Fullfil Each Functional Requirement</p><p>Go one-by-one through your functional requirements and add one, or sometimes several, external API endpoints needed to fulfill that requirement.</p>',9)]))}const m=t(n,[["render",o]]);export{d as __pageData,m as default};
